## Problem Specification

> “The sudden loss of employment and social interaction, and the added stressors of moving to remote work or schooling, and more recently, impacts of sudden, localised ‘lockdowns’ to prevent further outbreaks have **severely impacted** the mental health of many Australians.”

> “...while many people may not experience any long-term concerns, COVID-19 has the potential to contribute to or exacerbate long-term mental illness including anxiety, depression, PTSD, and substance misuse.”

During the many lockdowns we faced in Australia, most of the mental health screening services had to be offered via telephone or video consultations. And with the number of affected people increasing, there was a clear lack of resources we could access. There is still heavy uncertainty as to when and how things would return to normal. Hence, there is **a need for a new generation of mental healthcare tools that are as dynamic as the people they serve** in the post-COVID world.

## Idea

The idea behind this project is **to develop technology capable of building trusted relationships and conversations** with people. This can be achieved by deploying a bot service that can help ease the initial screening process for people who are seeking mental health related aid. 

Sometimes all we need is to talk to someone or have someone listen to us. Some of our most vulnerable moments happen at 2 am, when there’s no one around. BroBot is designed to be there for you, to have a tiny conversation, to vent out your feelings and to direct you to the right professionals if required.

## Approach

I believe that the above problem can be effectively solved using Artificial Intelligence. [Recent research articles](https://pursuit.unimelb.edu.au/articles/hey-siri-how-s-my-mental-health) have concluded that conversational systems have the potential to play a key role in future mental healthcare and also to help cut down global e-waste.
